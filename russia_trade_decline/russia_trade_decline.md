# The Collapse of Russian Arms Exports

## Context
Since April 2022, Russia has prohibited the publication of its import-export statistics. Among the most sensitive data, its arms production and exports remain of strategic importance for nations on both sides of the conflict. 

Open source information suggests that it has slowly but steadily ramped production capacity through the expansion of manufacturing plants and deepening alliances that guarantee deliveries of munitions and manpower. Western sanctions failed to weaken its war machine and stop the aggression. 

This success story can’t be told by the Russian arms exports industry.  Since Crimea’s invasion in early 2014, long-term strategic partners have nearly ceased placing new orders as buyers see Russian equipment burning and question its capacity to honour deliveries in the following years. From 2022, as Russia waged its full-scale war in Ukraine, exports begin to cease entirely.

**This project utilises the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) database to answer:**

- How does Russian arms exports pre-Crimea, post-Crimea and post-Full war compare?
- Which Russian partners are responsible for its decline?
- Which countries are filling the gap left by Russian arms?



## Takeaways

1. The yearly average TIV procured by Russian partners' shrinked by 42% in the period post-Crimea invasion. Their orders to Russia were down by 62%.

2. Out of 62 countries supplied between 2006-2013, 43 (69%) reduced orders to Russia after 2014, of which 26 ceased it entirely. After the full scale war, only Algeria, Belarus, Iran, Kazakhstan and Tajikistan remained.

3. Approximately 80% of Russia’s post-Crimea trade loss comes from India (-13,978 TIV), Viet Nam (-4544 ), Algeria (-3926), Venezuela (-3698) and Azerbaijan (-2020).

4. Aircrafts, Air Defence Systems, Armoured Vehicles, Missiles and Ships are historically the leading categories exported by Russia.  Major Russian partners turned to western-allied countries, in most cases for the first time at least since 2006. The main transactions regard:
  - French aircrafts; 
  - Israeli, British and French missiles;
  - South-Korean and British artillery systems;
  - German armoured vehicles; and
  - South-Korean, Dutch and American ships.

5. France (+835 TIV) and South Korea (+554) are the big winners in this shifting market. Despite the overall decline in the conventional weapons trade to Russian-aligned nations, they increased exports by sizable measures post-Crimea invasion. For reference, the United States (-1254), China (-1108) and the United Kingdom (-694) registered negative change in the same period.
